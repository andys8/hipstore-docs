# Getting the Cart Contents

We'd like to populate a field on the model called `cart` with the current contents of the cart which, when fetched, is a `List` of `Product`s just like the request from the last chapter.

Can you do this one on your own? If you get stuck, look back at [Displaying a List of Products.](/displaying-a-list-of-products.md)

Once you've finished, you can hook up the `cart` field from the model to the rendering function we're using from HipstoreUI and it'll display a count of the items in your cart.
